title: Worlds

The workflow `World` is an interface that abstracts how workflows and steps communicate with the outside world, letting you build custom adapters and reuse them across different environments, infrastructure, and hosting providers.

## What is a World?

A World implementation handles three core responsibilities:

- **Workflow Storage** - Persisting workflow state and event logs across function invocations
- **Step Execution** - Managing step function invocations with retries and error handling
- **Message Passing** - Communication between the workflow orchestrator and step functions

## Choosing a World

By default, Workflow automatically selects the appropriate world:

- **Local development**: Uses the [Local World](/worlds/local) for easy development with no external services
- **Vercel deployment**: Automatically switches to the [Vercel World](/worlds/vercel) for production

To use a different World implementation, set the `WORKFLOW_TARGET_WORLD` environment variable:

```bash
export WORKFLOW_TARGET_WORLD=@my-namespace/my-npm-package
export MY_WORLD_CONFIG=... # implementation-specific configuration
```

## Available Worlds

Visit the [Worlds Ecosystem](/worlds) page to explore:

- **Official Worlds** - Maintained by the Workflow team
- **Community Worlds** - Community-contributed implementations for various backends
- **Compatibility Status** - E2E test results for each world
- **Performance Benchmarks** - Execution time comparisons

## Building a Custom World

Want to create your own World implementation? A World must implement the following interface:

- Storage methods for runs, steps, hooks, and streams
- Queue management for step execution
- Authentication and authorization

See the [Local World](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/tree/main/packages/world-local) or [Postgres World](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/tree/main/packages/world-postgres) source code for reference implementations.

To add your World to the ecosystem:

1. Implement the World interface
2. Publish to npm
3. Open a PR to add your world to [`worlds-manifest.json`](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/blob/main/worlds-manifest.json)

Your world will then be automatically tested in CI and appear on the [Worlds Ecosystem](/worlds) page.
